This repository showcases various fundamental shell scripting concepts through a collection of basic scripts. 

**What You'll Find:**

* **Simple Scripts:** The scripts demonstrate core functionalities like:
    * **Printing Text:** Displaying messages on the screen.
    * **Commenting:** Adding explanatory notes within scripts.
    * **Variables:** Storing and manipulating data.
    * **Arrays:** Organizing data collections.
    * **Array Length:** Determining the number of elements in an array.
    * **Adding to Arrays:** Integrating new data into arrays.
    * **Arithmetic Operations:** Performing calculations with variables and numbers.
    * **For Loops:** Repetitive tasks controlled by loop conditions.
    * **App Installer:** (if applicable) A script to automate application installation.

**Learning Objectives:**

By exploring these scripts, you can gain a solid understanding of:

* **Shell Scripting Syntax:** Basic structure and commands used in shell scripts.
* **Data Manipulation:** Working with variables and arrays in scripts.
* **Flow Control:** Implementing loops for repetitive tasks.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Awais411/Shell-Scripting.git
   ```

2. **Explore the Scripts:**

   Each script focuses on a specific functionality. Open the scripts in a text editor and review the code and comments to understand the logic behind them. Feel free to experiment and modify them to practice your skills.

**Running the Scripts:**

* **Make Executable (if necessary):** Some scripts might require execution permissions. You can grant them using the **chmod +x script_name.sh** command (replace **script_name.sh** with the actual filename).
* **Execute the Script:** Once executable, run the script from your terminal by typing **./script_name.sh**

**Disclaimer:**

These scripts are primarily for learning purposes. Thoroughly test them in a non-production environment before using them for critical tasks.
